# Face Mask detection
This project is designed to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. The system uses Python programming language and OpenCV library for image processing and machine learning techniques.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV
Numpy
Tensorflow (optional)
Keras (optional)
Installation
Install Python 3.x from the official website
Install OpenCV and Numpy using pip
pip install opencv-python numpy
Install Tensorflow and Keras (optional) using pip
pip install tensorflow keras
Dataset
We have used a public dataset for face mask detection called "Face Mask Detection Dataset" which can be found here.

 
python detect_mask_video.py

# Output
The output of the system will be a video stream with bounding boxes around the faces and a label indicating whether the person is wearing a mask or not.
